## Introduction 
This simple application was created to demonstrate my knowledge of object oriented programming and database management using Ruby and ActiveRecord. The application is meant to hold recipes entered by the user. The recipes are organized by their name and flavors, by which the user can search for recipes. The user is also able to add or delete recipes. 

## Technologies
- Ruby 2.6
- TTY::Prompt 0.20
- ActiveRecord 5.2

## Launch
From the main directory, first install all necessary dependencies: 
```ruby 
bundle install 
``` 
Then run the application with : 
```ruby 
ruby bin/run.rb
``` 

## Example of Use 

## Project Status 
The project is usable and in working order. Suggestions have been made to spruce up the project with ASCII art and a login page, which I am considering for the future.
